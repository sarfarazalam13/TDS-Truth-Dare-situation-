# Truth Dare Situation(TDS)
## FEATURES
* Eliminates the bottle.

* Calculate Score (under progress.)
* Auto generated Dares and Truths if needed by the user.
* User can play online,sitting far away in the house,as there is no bottle pointing to anyone.

**Problems with the traditional version of TDS**
A traditonal version of TDS uses a bottle and that is the biggest problem, because using a bottle limits the game, i can only ask or challange the person sitting vertically opposite to me.

Frankly we all have at some point experienced that the bottle is not that random and in this lockdown we cannot expet to turn bottes on any online platform.

While playing we cannot calculate the score,and sometimes our friends dont have questions left with them and the game slowly turns out to be boaring.

**This code has eliminated all the above mentioned problems**

# Instructions
You need to first enter the number of players,and then then the names.
after this the compiler will ask you weather user wants computer generated Questions or they just want the randomly generated names which here doesen't account for the position you are sitting.

if you choose the computer generated option,only one name is generated and the compile asks to choose between truth and dare.This is onne of the two modes,to turn back to the main menu user must follow the instruction by the compiler.

once thr user turns back to the main menu,and plays in the second mode the compiler generates two random names and labels them for Questioning and Answering.

User can choose to exit after returning to the main menu.

It is to be noted that all the above functions can be used infinitely without re running the code.

# How to use?
Download the .cpp file and run it on any compiler.
